This is a generic self-balancing binary search tree.

This structure uses void pointers for the value stored. You can define what
data type you want to use. You have to write three functions for your data type:
create, destroy and compare. In example.c there are already implemented functions
for long and string data types.

There are no pointers to NULL. A dummy done named nil replaces the NULL pointer.

This tree is also a sorted double-linked list formed from all the nodes.
